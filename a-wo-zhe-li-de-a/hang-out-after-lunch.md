# hang out after lunch

I have just walk around the campus after lunch&#x20;

### I get some

1. I always hold the idea that something is hard, but do it really is? how to manage it?
2. I have the feeling that walk into _lotus pond _or_ small garden _is a strange thing for others to catch sight of, do it really is? how do you know? what the consequence of if it really does?&#x20;
3. what the thought girls hold, when look at me? for me, what can I do in respond of that?&#x20;
4. why I should back to dorm? what will I do next? why?

#### it all seems that I list out bunch of questions, but the point is it's all really a brand-new point of view to understand the world.&#x20;

#### cherish it, it just like I come back to this earth again
