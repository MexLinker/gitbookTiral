# what's A?

I have three theory

### all in function

#### explain me and the world as function

when I step once, which give the world function an input, and the output for me is change of sight and air flow.  
For me, the input is the change of sight and air flow, I will out put the next step.  
then, what I need to do is to reconsider both the functions.

### Two A, A&lt;-&gt;A

at an idealism's point, I want to create a new personal A  
but I should reference the old A I made to continuously fetch from the real world.

### graph theory

I have made a whole graph, which is my old perspective of the world, consist of points and ligature  
I want to cut off it and rebuild it again
